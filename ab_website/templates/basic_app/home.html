        <h3>First Tic Tac Toe Game (Python) - <a

        <p>This project was definitely a rough one. At the time I was learning about functions and basic loops. I can
            see now that not
            naming my function parameters was a bad idea because it confused me in the long run. It's also clear that I
            didn't understand
            the DRY principle, you can see that in the victory conditions.</p>

        <h3>Email Automation/Excel Project (Python) - <a
                href="https://github.com/andrewbrase/Early_Projects/blob/main/03_Mail_Automation_Project/automate_mail_ipc.ipynb"

        <p>This was an idea that I had to automate sending troubleshooting emails from my previous position.
            Openpyxl is a Python library that is used to read from an Excel file or write to an Excel file. Using
            Openpyxl
            to collect device data such as serial numbers, mac addresses etc. I could send an email to tech support to
            try and resolve the device issues with that order.
            An App Password is a unique 16-digit passcode that gives a non-Google app or device permission to access
            your Google Account.
            This allows me to send emails and have a target email to send this info to i.e. tech support.

        <h3>Hangman Game (JavaScript HTML CSS) - <a
                href="https://github.com/andrewbrase/Early_Projects/blob/main/06_Hangman_Project/index.js"

                Link</a>
        </h3>
        <p>I had a lot of fun making this game because it has a graphical interface and also made me understand that
            just like human languages, programming languages can have similarities and differences. Learning the syntax
            for JavaScript was similar to Python but it also has key differences. I learned a lot about EventListeners
            and
            how to implement them on a HTML page.
        </p>

        <h3>Teacher App (JavaScript HTML CSS) - <a
                href="https://github.com/andrewbrase/Early_Projects/blob/main/07_Teacher_App/index.js" target="_blank"

            This was a project that I started in collaboration with my fiance. She works in the child development field
            and
            said that having a way to track students health needs, whereabouts and classroom DCFS compliance would be
            helpful for her.
            This was when I was first learning about OOP and how to organize objects in a way to contain data and
            methods to operate on that data.
            Every child entry can be created using a class and can contain data such as age, classroom etc.
